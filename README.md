## ü§ñ Google AI Studio Setup

To enable AI-powered search, you must configure an API key.

### Step 1: Get API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app).
2. Log in with your Google account.
3. Navigate to "API Access" or go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
4. Create a project and enable **Generative Language API**.
5. Generate an API key under **Credentials**.

### Step 2: Add API Key to `.env`

In your `.env` file, add the key as:

```env
AI_TOOL_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key
```

This key allows the app to communicate with Google AI to interpret user queries.
